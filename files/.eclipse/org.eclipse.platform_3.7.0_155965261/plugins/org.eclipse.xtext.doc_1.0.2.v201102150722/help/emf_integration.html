<p>Xtext relies heavily on EMF internally, but it can also be used as the serialization back-end of other EMF-based tools.
			In this section we introduce the basic concepts of the 
			<a class="ulink" href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf" target="_new">Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)</a> in the context of Xtext.  
			If you want to learn more about EMF, we recommend reading the 
			<a class="ulink" href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf" target="_new">EMF book</a>.

<p>When Xtext uses EMF models as the in-memory representation of any parsed text files. This in-memory object graph is called the 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Abstract Syntax Tree</em></span> (AST). 
				Depending on the community this concepts is also called 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>document object graph (DOM)</em></span>, 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>semantic model</em></span>, or simply 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>model</em></span>. We use 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>model</em></span> and 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>AST</em></span> interchangeably. 
				Given the example model from the 
				<a class="link" href="getting-started.html#getting-started-xtext" title="Creating a DSL">introduction</a>, the AST looks similar to this
			</p>

<p>
			
</p>
<p>The 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>AST</em></span> should contain the essence of your textual models and abstract over syntactical information. It is used by later processing steps, 
				such as validation, compilation or interpretation. In EMF a model is made up of instances of 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EObjects</em></span> which are connected 
				and an 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EObject</em></span> is an instance of an 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EClass</em></span>. 
				A set of 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EClasses</em></span> if contained in a so called 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EPackage</em></span>, which are both concepts of 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Ecore</em></span> 
				In Xtext, meta models are either inferred from the grammar or predefined by the user (see the section on 
				<a class="link" href="syntax.html#package_declarations" title="EPackage Declarations">package declarations</a> for details). The next diagram shows the meta model of our example:
			</p>
<p>
				
</p>
<div class="mediaobject">
<img src="images/metamodel.png"></div>
<p> 
			
</p>
<p>The language in which the meta model is defined is called 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Ecore</em></span>. In other words, the meta model is the Ecore model of your language. Ecore an essential part of EMF. Your your models instantiate the meta model, and your meta model instantiates Ecore. To put an end to this recursion, Ecore is defined in itself (an instance of itself). 
			</p>
<p>The meta model defines the types of the semantic nodes as Ecore 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EClasses</em></span>. EClasses are shown as boxes in the meta mode diagram, so in our example, 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Model</em></span>, 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Type</em></span>, 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>SimpleType</em></span>, 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Entity</em></span>, and 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Property</em></span> are EClasses. An EClass can inherit from other EClasses. Multiple inheritance is allowed in Ecore, but of course cycles are forbidden.  
			</p>
<p>EClasses can have 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EAttributes</em></span> for their simple properties. These are shown inside the EClasses nodes. The example contains two EAttributes 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> and one EAttribute 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>isMulti</em></span>. The domain of values for an EAttribute is defined by its 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EDataType</em></span>. Ecore ships with some predefined 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EDataTypes</em></span>, which essentially refer to Java primitive types and other immutable classes like String. To make a distinction from the Java types, the EDataTypes are prefixed with an 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>E</em></span>. In our example, that&rsquo;s 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EString</em></span> and 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EBoolean</em></span>.  
			</p>
<p>In contrast to EAttributes, 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EReferences</em></span> point to other EClasses. The 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>containment</em></span> flag indicates whether an EReference is a 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>containment reference</em></span> or a 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>cross-reference</em></span>. In the diagram, references are edges and containment references are marked with a diamond. At the model level, each element can have at most one container, i.e. another element referring to it with a containment reference. This infers a tree structure to the models, as can be seen in the sample model diagram. On the other hand, 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>cross-references</em></span> refer to elements that can be contained anywhere else. In the example, 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>elements</em></span> and 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>properties</em></span> are containment references, while 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>type</em></span> and 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>extends</em></span> are cross-references. For reasons of readability, we skipped the cross-references in the sample model diagram. Note that in contrast to other parser generators, Xtext creates ASTs with linked cross-references. 
			</p>
<p>Other than associations in UML, EReferences in Ecore are always owned by one EClass and only navigable in the direction form the owner to the type. Bi-directional associations must be modeled as two references, being 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>eOpposite</em></span> of each other and owned by either end of the associations.
			</p>
<p>The superclass of EAttibutes and EReferences is 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EStructuralFeature</em></span> and allows to define a name and a cardinality by setting 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>lowerBound</em></span> and 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>upperBound</em></span>. Setting the latter to -1 means &lsquo;unbounded&rsquo;. 
			</p>
<p>The common supertype of EDataType and EClass is 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EClassifier</em></span>. An 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>EPackage</em></span> acts as a namespace and container of EClassifiers. 
			</p>
<p>We have summarized these most relevant concepts of Ecore in the following diagram:  </p>
