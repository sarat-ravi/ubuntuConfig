<p>A 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Domain-Specific Language (DSL)</em></span> is a small programming language, which focuses on a particular domain.
				Such a domain can be more or less anything. The idea is that its concepts and notation is as close as possible to
				what you have in mind when you think about a solution in that domain. Of course we are talking about problems which can
				be solved or processed by computers somehow.
			</p>
<p>The opposite of a DSL is a so called 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>GPL</em></span>, a 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>General Purpose Language</em></span> such as Java or any other common programming language.
				With a GPL you can solve every computer problem, but it might not always be the best way to solve it.
			</p>
<p>Imagine you want to remove the core from an apple. You could of course use a Swiss army knife to cut it out, 
				and this is reasonable if you have to do it just once or twice. But if you need to do that on a regular 
				basis it might be more efficient to use an apple corer.</p>
<p>There are a couple of well-known examples of DSLs. For instance SQL is actually a DSL which focuses on 
				querying relational databases. Other DSLs are regular expressions or even languages provided by tools 
				like MathLab. Also most XML languages are actually domain-specific languages. The whole purpose of XML is 
				to allow for easy creation of new languages. Unfortunately, XML uses a fixed concrete syntax, which is 
				very verbose and yet not adapted to be read by humans. Into the bargain, a generic syntax for everything is a compromise.</p>
<p>Xtext is a sophisticated framework that helps to implement your very own DSL with appropriate IDE support. 
				There is no such limitation as with XML, you are free to define your concrete syntax as you like. It may 
				be as concise and suggestive as possible being a best match for your particular domain. The hard task of 
				reading your model, working with it and writing it back to your syntax is greatly simplified by Xtext.</p>
