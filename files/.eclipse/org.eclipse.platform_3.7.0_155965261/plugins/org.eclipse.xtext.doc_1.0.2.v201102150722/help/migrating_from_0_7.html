<p>Most of the tasks when migrating to Xtext 1.0 can be automated. Some changes will be necessary in the manually written code where you have to carefully
			verify that your implementation is still working with Xtext 1.0. A reliable test-suite helps a lot. </p>
<p>The grammar language is fully backward compatible. You should not have to apply any changes in the primary artifact. However, we introduced some additional
			validation rules that mark inconsistencies in your grammar. If you get any warnings in the grammar editor, it should be straight forward to fix them.</p>
<p>
			
<span class="emphasis"><em>Tip: You&rsquo;ll learn something about the new features if you compare a freshly created Xtext project based on 0.7.x with a new Xtext project based on 1.0. Especially the new fragments in the workflow are a good indicator for useful new features.</em></span>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t made too many customizations to the generated defaults and if you&rsquo;re not referencing many classes of your Xtext language from the outside, you might consider starting with a new Xtext project, copying your grammar and then manually restoring your changes step by step. If that does not work for you, go on reading!</p>
