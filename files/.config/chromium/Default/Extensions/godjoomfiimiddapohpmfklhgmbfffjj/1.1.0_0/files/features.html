<h2><a href="http://github.com/jinzhu/vrome">Vrome</a> - The most cool, featured Vim keybindings extension for Chrome you could found!</h2>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Help</h3>

<pre><code>        &lt;F1&gt;      Open help page
</code></pre>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<pre><code>        o         Open one or more URLs in current tab. Multiple URLs can be separated with ','.
                  The first URL is opened in the current tab, and all other URLs are opened in new tabs.
                  There are some powerful features here:
                  1, AutoComplete support:
                  &lt;Down&gt;,&lt;Up&gt;   Navigate next/previous link. (You can change the behavior in config, please see http://goo.gl/koFEh)
                  &lt;Tab&gt;,&lt;S-Tab&gt; Navigate the next/previous 10th link. (You can change the behavior in config, please see http://goo.gl/koFEh)
                  &lt;Enter&gt;       Open selected link in current tab.
                  &lt;C-Enter&gt;     Open selected link in new tab. and keep AutoComplete list open so you can open another link.
                  &lt;C-[0-9]&gt;     Open links marked with red number.
                                The red number is the relative index of the currently selected link.
                                E.g: you can use &lt;C-5&gt; the open the 5th link, &lt;C-7&gt; to open the 7th one.
                                It would be really cool when works with &lt;Tab&gt;, &lt;S-Tab&gt;

                  Btw, you could turn off AutoComplete if you want. Please refer Wiki for how to.

                  2, Relative path support:
                  Try to type '/admin', '..', '../..', '../../rails', './wiki' when visiting `http://github.com/jinzhu/vrome`
                  It is supposed to open http://github.com/admin, http://github.com/jinzhu ... for you.
                  I believe it would be really useful for website administrator, developer or even everyone.

                  3, Search Engine:
                  Try `google vrome` to search vrome with google. `google` is the search engine name, `vrome` is the keyword.
                  `google`, `answers`, `yahoo`, `wikipedia`, `bing`, `twitter` are built in search engines.
                  You could define you own one, checkout [Customize Your Vrome](https://github.com/jinzhu/vrome/wiki/customize-your-vrome) for how to.

                  You can even omit the search engines name, then would search it with the default search engine.
                  The default one is google, you can change it in Vrome's option page.

        O         Opens one or more URL in current tab, based on current location. (refer `o` for more)
        t         Opens one or more URL in new tab. (refer `o` for more)
        T         Opens one or more URL in new tab, based on current location. (refer `o` for more)

        ]]        Go to next page. You can customize the rule in Vrome option page.

[count] gu        Go to parent URL
        gU        Go to the root of the website

        y         Copy current URL to clipboard
        &lt;C-y&gt;     Copy a shorten URL to clipboard, the URL is shortened by `http://goo.gl`
                  You can show the shortened URL on your dashboard on http://goo.gl, Refer Vrome option page for how to.

        p         Open a URL based on the selected or clipboard contents in current tab.
                  Would search the content with default search engine if it is not a URL.
        P         Open a URL based on the selected or clipboard contents in new tab. (refer `p` for more)

[count] &lt;C-a&gt;     Increments the last number in URL by 1, or by [count] if given.

                  e.g: When you visiting `http://github.com`, you could add `github.com` to quick mark `g` with `Mg`,
