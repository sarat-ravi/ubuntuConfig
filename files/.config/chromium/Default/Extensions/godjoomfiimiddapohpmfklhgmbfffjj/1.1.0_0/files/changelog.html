<p>1.0.0 (2012/01/01)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first public and stable release after two more years development!</p>

<p>We did lots of changes in this release, suggest you to read the README once again.</p>

<p>But I would like to list those abandon key binding from old versions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>"d" is not supported to close current tab now. use "dc" for that.</p>

<p>(Because we have added some hotkeys started with "d".  "dc", "dm", "do", "dl", "dr", "dp", "dP". refer Features for detail)</p></li>
<li><p>"&lt;Esc>" is not supported to enable Vrome after disabled it with "&lt;C-z>". use "&lt;C-Esc>" (Control+Esc) for that.</p>

<p>(Because "&lt;Esc>" is used much often than "&lt;C-Esc>")</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
